# This is a test post
Heres some text to demo a paragraph for the system

## Lesser, less important title
This is a less important paragraph, because it is after a less important title

> the following element should be an elegant line that divides the page, in an integrated way with the text
------------
Heres an unordered list:
- first item
- second item
- third item
- fourth item
- fifth item

Heres an ordered list
1. nebulus item
2. mysterious item
3. random item
4. threatening item

> the following element is also a line that divides the page, no differences with the first one

### Text with character formatting
This paragraph **RIGHT HERE** has multiple *formatted* elements, this is to demostrate the capacity of the html compiler to recognize and interpret these patterns, well, maybe calling it a compiler is a bit much, however, this does demostrate the capacity to show a real page in this manner, rather a raw demostration, but effective, at least in my opinion. While technically being able to do any formatting, I would much rather use a standanrdized formatting that other people have contributed and docummented, and saves me of creating a way to format text, *hooray!*.

#### Links & tabulations
Heres a number of pages that I frequent, each list is (roughly) randomly tabulated, but they all take to the same page
- [duck](https://duckduckgo.com/)
- [duck](https://duckduckgo.com/)
- [go](https://duckduckgo.com/)
    - [quack](https://duckduckgo.com/)
    - [quack](https://duckduckgo.com/)
        - [duckies](https://duckduckgo.com/)

##### Tables!
Finally, here are some tables, tables are part that interests me the most, basically, because tables are something I *hate* in classic HTML, what an ugly mess, though it works! so I can't really complain about functionality

| this | is | a | table |
|:------|:----:|---:|-------|
| funny|content|of|the|
|table|goes|here|alas|
left|centered|right|none
this|is|still|table
none|is|just|right
which|is|the|default
still|table
|||also|table
||middle|rows

###### Requirements - Checked list
A demostration of checked list, along with the smallest title supported
- [x] this is a checked list
- [ ] text should be displayed
- [x] with a box checked or 
- [ ] unchecked, depending
- [x] on if the prefix of this list
- [x] has an "x" or not
- [ ] its quite the elegant solution
- [x] for a system like this
- [x] I don't know if I can think 
- [ ] of a very effective way
- [ ] for this to be flexible in HTML
